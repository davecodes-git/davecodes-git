# 👋 Hi, I'm Dave Mejia

💻 **Django Web Developer** | Building real-world applications with Django, TailwindCSS, Bootstrap, and HTMX.  

I enjoy creating **database-driven apps** with clean UI and interactive features — all without the need for heavy frontend frameworks.  
My focus is on building apps that are simple, scalable, and production-ready.
